# [Normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics))


## [Z-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score)

z = (x - µ) / σ,  µ is mean and σ is standard deviation.


## IQR-normalization

The IQR-normalization is more robust to the presence of outliers than a classical Z-score (centering to the mean with unit SD), but the 1.35 scaling factor makes both normalization equivalent whenever the data happens to be normally distributed. 

xn = (x - median) / IQR * 1.35
