## Airlines

The dataset to be operated on is the publicly available [airlines dataset](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp), which contains twenty years of flight records (from 1987 to 2008). I am interested in predicting airline arrival delay based on the flight departure delay, aircraft type, and distance traveled.
