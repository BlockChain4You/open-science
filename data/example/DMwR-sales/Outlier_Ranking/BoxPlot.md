Where will Data Science be in 2065?

Answer from David Donoho in his article "50 years of Data Science", published on September 18, 2015:   Open Science takes over.

In principle, the purpose of scientic publication is to enable reproducibility of research findings. In absolute terms the amount of essentially non-reproducible research is far larger than ever before. To meet the original goal of scientic publication, one should share the underlying code and data. 

Reproducibility of computational experiments is just as important to industrial data science as
it is to scientic publication. It enables a disciplined approach to proposing and evaluating potential
system improvements and an easy transition of validated improvements into production use.
